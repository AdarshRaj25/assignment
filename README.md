## ðŸŽ¯ Objective Overview

### ðŸ§© Objective 1 â€” Basic Functions & Header Files
- Learn to create and include *user-defined header files*
- Understand *function declaration, **definition, and **calling*
- Practice *modular programming*

*Files:*
- mylib.h â€” Function declarations  
- mylib.c â€” Function definitions  
- main1.c â€” Calls and tests the functions

### ðŸ”¢ Objective 2 â€” Array Operations
- Perform operations such as:
  - Displaying array elements  
  - Finding *maximum* and *minimum* values  
  - Calculating the *average*
- Learn *array passing* to functions
- Reinforce modular design with *separate .h and .c files*

*Files:*
- arraylib.h â€” Function declarations for array operations  
- arraylib.c â€” Function definitions  
- main2.c â€” Main driver program

## âš™ How to Compile and Run

### âœ… Using GCC (on command line)
1. Open the folder (for example Objective-2)
2. Run the following commands:

```bash
gcc main2.c arraylib.c -o output.exe
./output.exe
